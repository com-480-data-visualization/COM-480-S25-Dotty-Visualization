# Project Goal: Dotty Compiler Visualization

## Core Visualization (Minimal Viable Product)

### Repository Structure Visualization
- Interactive tree/graph visualization of the Dotty codebase structure
- Highlight main components and their relationships
- Basic filtering options to focus on specific packages/modules

### Contributor Network
- Basic network graph showing main contributors
- Visualize collaboration patterns between developers
- Filter by time period and project area

### Performance Metrics Dashboard ?
- Simple charts showing compiler performance metrics

## Enhancement Ideas

### Advanced Features
1. **Interactive Code Explorer**
   - Clickable visualization of code dependencies
   - Animated code flow visualization during compilation phases
   - Syntax highlighting and code preview integration

2. **Git History Playback**
   - Animated replay of repository evolution
   - Visual diff of key architectural changes
   - Highlight critical refactoring points

3. **Contributor Activity Heatmap**
   - Time-based visualization of developer activity
   - Geographic distribution of contributors
   - Topic specialization analysis

4. **Performance Comparison Tool**
   - Side-by-side visualization of performance between Dotty and Scala 2
   - Interactive benchmarking visualization
   - Hardware impact analysis

### Visual Enhancements
1. **3D Visualization Options**
   - 3D code structure visualization
   - VR/AR compatibility for immersive code exploration

2. **Real-time Data Integration**
   - Live updates from repository changes
   - CI/CD pipeline visualization integration

3. **Custom Theming and Accessibility**
   - Dark/light mode toggle
   - Configurable color schemes for better accessibility
   - Screen reader optimizations

4. **Export and Sharing Features**
   - Generate shareable visualizations
   - Export to various formats (PNG, SVG, interactive HTML)
   - Embeddable widgets for documentation

## Implementation Approach
- Process the data into a small set and a large set.
  * Small set: conatains all essential data from last year
  * Large set: contains all data from the repository
  We use the small set for development and testing, and the large set for the final visualization.
- Build a modular architecture where each visualization panel is independent
- Start with the core features in simplified form
- Use progressive enhancement to add features without breaking core functionality
- Implement responsive design from the beginning
