The network graph shows the dependencies between a selected range of files in the compiler. 
The size of each node represents the number of usgaes of the file.
By forcusing on a given module, we can see how the files are interconnected and which files are most important in terms of dependencies, without being distracted by some commonly used helper files.
Similarly, by clicking on a node, the user will be redirected to the corresponding file in the GitHub repository.
