This is a Treemap visualization of the Scala 3 compiler source code. The size of each rectangle is proportional to the number of modified lines of code during a period. The color indicates the category of the source file.
The time period can be selected in different ways, such as two version numbers or two dates.
By adjusting the time period, you can see how the proportion has changed over time.
The graph is a good way to visualize the focus of the development team during a specific period.
By clicking on a rectangle, the user will be redirected to the corresponding file in the GitHub repository.
